### The book has a number of aims:
- To teach the use of the standard Linux C libraries and other facilities as specified by the various Linux and UNIX standards.

- To show how to make the most of the standard Linux development tools.
To give a concise introduction to data storage under Linux using both the DBM and MySQL database systems.

- To show how to build graphical user interfaces for the X Window System. We will use both the GTK (the basis of the GNOME environment) and Qt (the basis of the KDE environment) libraries.
