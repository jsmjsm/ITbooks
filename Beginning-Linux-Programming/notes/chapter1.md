# Chapter 1: Getting Started
## UNIX Philosophy 
"Although programming in C is in many ways the same whatever the platform, UNIX and Linux developers have a special view of program and system development."

### The characters of UNIX programs and system
- Simplify: KISS -> "Keep It Small and Simple"
- Focus: Programs with a single purpose are easier to improve as better algorithms or interface are developed 
- Reusable Components: Make your code of your application available as a library
- Filters: UNIX applications can be used as filters.
- Open File Formats: The more successful and popular UNIX programs use configuration files and data files that are plain ASCII text or XML.
- Flexibility: Try to be as flexible as possible in your programming. Try to avoid arbitrary limits on field sizes or number of records.
## What is Linux?
Linux is a freely distributed implementation of a UNIX-like kernel,the low level core of an operating system

## Programming Linux 
It is true that UNIX was originally written in C and that majority of UNIX applications are written in C, but C is not the only option available to Linux programmers, or UNIX programmers for the matter.

## Linux Programs
Linux applications are represented by two special types of files: *executables* and *scripts*.
**Executable:** files are programs that can be run directly by the computer;
**Script:** collections of instructions for another program.
