# Chapter 1: Getting Started
## UNIX Philosophy 
"Although programming in C is in many ways the same whatever the platform, UNIX and Linux developers have a special view of program and system development."
### The characters of UNIX programs and system
- Simplify: KISS -> "Keep It Small and Simple"
- Focus: Programs with a single purpose are easier to improve as better algorithms or interface are developed 
- Reusable Components: Make your code of your application available as a library
- Filters: UNIX applications can be used as filters.
- Open File Formats: The more successful and popular UNIX programs use configuration files and data files that are plain ASCII text or XML.
- Flexibility: Try to be as flexible as possible in your programming. Try to avoid arbitrary limits on field sizes or number of records.
